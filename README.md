## Description
Not-Book is a game created for the Upsijam 3.0 game jam, which had the theme "It is not supposed to do that". In this game, the player controls a character named "Not", who is stuck in a book and must do everything that is explained in the game. The gameplay is similar to a runner game, where the goal is to reach the end of the level as fast as possible.

## Play the Game!
